When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r num1}
#a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment

#On your file pane select "Upload", "Choose File" then find your file to upload and select "OK"  
mpg <- read.csv("mpg.csv")
mpg

#b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
#The variables that are categorical from the mpg dataset are manufacturer, model, trans(transmission) , drv (type of drive),
#fl (fuel type), and class

#c. Which are continuous variables?
#The variables that are continuous are displ (engine displacement), year, cyl(number of cylinders), cty (city miles per gallon),
#and hwy (highway miles per gallon).

```
